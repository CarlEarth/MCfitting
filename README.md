# MCfitting
simple Monte Carlo Example

It is a simple example to realize Monte Carlo.
In the code, we give some fake data points slghtly diviate from the y=2x+4, and try to 
fit them with linear equation (y=ax+b). By calaulating the Max Likelihood or the min Xisquare,
and we can find the bestfit values of a and b.

Finally, the output picture let us know the concept of Monte Carlo method more easily.
